    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a Generative AI Professional. My academic journey has been a rough, but I presevere through it all and push myself over my limits whether it be programming or the regularity of life. I was never a good learner and student because I used to neglect my academics and never took it seriously until now. I was clueless with a certain point of my life and pondering where did I went wrong and how can I recover from this mess of myself. I use to think there were shortcuts to this journey and easy way to get to where I want to be, but I learned that I need to work hard and learn in order to reach my goals. I failed so many times miserably that I started losing hope in securing a career in software development, but now, I started questioning everything I do before I proceed and make sure I am on track to complete my studies and have the necessary skills to be ready for any problems that appears. As of right now, I am completing my A.S. Computer Information Systems @ FCC in July 2024 and planning to transfer to a 4-yr university in California to complete my studies for B.S. in Computer Science around Spring 2025. I grew up playing games my whole life and was expose to coding because of Minecraft and ROBLOX. Programming is my passion because I love to build projects from scratch and solve problems that occurs. As more difficult and challenging my error gets, this gives me a sense of purpose to want to find a solution and debug errors within my code. As of right now, I am looking to be a Generative AI Professional and advancing my coding skill for C++/C as a side hobby. You can follow along and check out my most recent works on my profile as coding is my passion and what I enjoy to do on my free time. Now, without even thinking, I feel like I have become a programmer and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output that will one day lead me to my goals. -Sit
