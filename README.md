**`Casual Programmer (Game Developer/App Creator/Code Enthusiast) `**

I am a beginner programmer who is looking to learn more languages and get experience within Cyber Security / Game Development / Programming. I am currently working towards my A.S. Computer Information Systems @ FCC and planning to transfer to a 4-yr university in California to get B.S. in Computer Science. I grew up with playing games my whole life and was expose to coding because of Minecraft. Coding is my passion because I love to build projects from scratch and solve problems that occurs. As the more difficult and challenging my issues gets, this makes me want to find a solution and patch it up. You can follow along and check out my most recent works on my profile as coding is my passion and what I enjoy to do on my free time.
