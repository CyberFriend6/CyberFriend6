    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a Software Engineer. I struggled with self teaching myself how to code and be good learner as discipline and being steady focus was hard enough with distractions and situational life events. Too add to these negative, it was much more difficult also due to not having a clear path or plan and was going blindly into the world of programming without any guidance too. I also took a different path trying to make a career as a nurse, but felt like I had a hole in my heart which was my purpose to live. I genuinely took time off to contemplate and finally rediscover my passion for programming and set my path on my journey to reinvent myself and work my way up to become a Software Engineer. Took me years to realize I have been doing the same beginner programming concept repetitively resulting me to start understanding programming as a whole. I am grateful to where I am currently because without all these mistakes and errors I have come across, I would had not become the problem solver I am today and be able to critically think for myself. Now, without even thinking, I believe I have become a programmer by heart and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output that will one day lead me to my end goal.
