  <summary><h3>🧑 Sit's Progress</summary>
    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a software engineer. My journey has been a rough and bumpy road, but I presevere through it all and push myself over my limits whether it be programming or the regularity of life. I was never a good learner and student as I used to neglect my academics and never took it seriously until now. I was clueless with a certain point of my life and pondering where did I went wrong and how can I recover from this mess of myself. I use to think there were shortcuts to this journey and easy way to get to where I want to be, but I learned that I need to work hard and learn in order to reach my goals. I failed so many times over and over again that it drove me crazy, but now, I started questioning everything I do before I proceed and make sure I am on track to complete my studies and have the necessary skills to be ready for any problems that appears. As of right now, I am learning as much as I can and gaining useful skillsets in order to become a professional programmer. Now, without even thinking, I feel like I have become a problem solver and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output which will lead me to my goals. -Sit
