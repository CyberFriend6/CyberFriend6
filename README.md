    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a Software Engineer. My academic journey has been tough because of uncontrollable situations, but I push myself over my limits whether it be programming or life in order to reach my end goal of landing a career in the software development field. I was never a good learner and student because I used to neglect my academics and never took it seriously until now. I use to believe that there were shortcuts and easy ways to get to my end goal, but I learned that I need to work hard, gain experience and overall learn what my tasks are. I failed so many times miserably when starting off self-learning coding that I started losing hope, but now, I started questioning everything I do before I proceed and made significant progress to be on track to complete my studies and have the required skillsets to be ready for any problems that appears in my future career. As of now, I have just completed my studies for A.S. in Computer Information Systems @ Fresno City College July 2024 and plan to transfer to a 4-yr university in California to complete my studies for B.S. in Computer Science starting Spring 2025 to learn more about data structures, algorithms and problem solving. As a child, I grew up playing games my whole life and was expose to coding because of Minecraft and ROBLOX learning my ways from configuring and setting up my own minecraft server and testing things out in ROBLOX studio. Programming is my passion because I love to build projects from scratch and solve problems that occurs. As more difficult and challenging my error gets, this gives me a sense of desire to find a solution and debug errors within my code. As of right now, I am looking for a software engineering internship opportunity to enhance and further develop my skillset. I am currently trying to advance my coding skill for Python and C++ during my free time and learning more about specific classes and libraries will help me build a foundation for each of the programming skills. I like working on game projects especially in ROBLOX because it gives me experience within Game Development and is quite fun and a passion of mine as I script and build on my own. In the near future, I would like to progress further to other game development IDE once I have reached my goals of becoming a software Engineer. You can follow along and check out my most recent works on my profile as coding is my passion and what I enjoy to do on my free time. Now, without even thinking, I feel like I have become a programmer and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output that will one day lead me to my goals. -Sit
