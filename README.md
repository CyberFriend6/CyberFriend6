  <summary><h3>üßë Sit's Progress</summary>
    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a Software Engineer. I made sure to push myself whether it be programming or life in order to progress further so I can reach my goal of landing a career in software development. I failed so many times when starting off learning how to code myself as I did not have plan or guideline that I can refer to. I started losing hope, but turned my life around when I started questioning everything I do before I proceed and made progress by completing my studies and have the required skillsets to be ready for any problems that appears in my future career. As of now, I have just completed my studies for A.S. in Computer Information Systems at Fresno City College July 2024 and plan to transfer to a 4-yr university in California to complete my studies for a Bachelors in Computer Science starting Spring 2025 to learn more about data structures, algorithms and problem solving techniques required by the industry. As a child, I grew up playing games my whole life and was expose to coding because of Minecraft and ROBLOX learning my ways from configuring and setting up my own minecraft server and testing out ROBLOX Studio. Programming is my passion because I love to build projects from scratch and solve problems that occurs. As more difficult and challenging my error gets, this encourage me to find a solution and debug errors within my code. As of right now, I am looking for an internship within software engineering to enhance and further develop my professional experience. I am currently trying to advance my technical programming skill for Python during my free time and learning more about specific classes,  libraries and frameworks that will help me become more proficient within the language. I like working on game projects especially in ROBLOX because it gives me experience within Game Development and is a passion of mine as I script my own code and build my own models. In the near future, I would like to progress further to Generative AI field once I have reached my goals of becoming an experienced Software Engineer. You can follow along and check out my most recent works on my profile as coding is my passion and what I enjoy to do on my free time. Now, without even thinking, I believe I have become a programmer by heart and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output that will one day lead me to my end goal.
