**`Software Engineering`** **`Game Development`** **`Generative AI`** 

Motivated self-learner and classroom-educated programmer looking for internship opportunity to further develop my professional skills and experience for software development. I am proficient in programming with C++, Python and Lua. I have a passion for game development in ROBLOX. My current favorite form of entertainment is learning new topics within  artificial intelligence as it peaks my current interest because I want to learn more about it to possibly land a career in Generative AI.

    Hello! if you are reading this, it means you are interested in my story of struggles to become a Software Engineer. I struggled with teaching myself how to code while being a full time college student and working a full-time job trying to stay discipline, but eventually I cracked. To add to these negative, it was much more difficult also due to not having a clear path or plan and was going blindly into the world of programming without any guidance too. I also took a break to pursue a different career within the medical field, but felt like I had a hole in my heart which was my purpose to live so it has resulted to me going back to do the very thing I love, programming. I genuinely took time off to contemplate and finally rediscover my passion for programming and set my path on my journey to reinvent myself and work my way up to become a Software Engineer. I spent most of my education within Fresno City College, as I have graduated and received my A.S in Computer Information Systems learning IT fundamentals computer networking and programming and will also be ready to transfer to a CSU to work on a BS in Computer Science. It took me many years to realize I have been making the same mistakes and doing the same programming concept repetitively resulting me to start understanding programming as a whole. I am grateful to where I am currently because without all these mistakes and errors I have come across, I would have not been pursuing a career as a software engineer . Now, without even thinking, I believe I have become a programmer by heart and coding is engraved within me as I like to believe that this world runs like computers working through while, ifs and for loops statements to reach a certain action and output that will one day lead me to my end goal.
